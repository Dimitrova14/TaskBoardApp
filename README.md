> _ðŸ§ª A source code of a .NET Core application to be tested, provided by Software University - Bulgaria_

## Test cases
Written test cases by me for this appliation can be found on [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13SU_3rEFU_LCW3LDiKVlA823Y8k3MAxC/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101865710122533479047&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

My tests improved the quality of the software by:

**1.Catching critical bugs** - critical defects were caught and reported as they would have been costly if they reached production.

Bugs found:

1.API & Edit page cannot be accessed 
2.Tasks are deleted after they have been created

**2.Increasing code reliability** - features were tested under various negative conditions, which made software proner to errors.

Bugs found:

1.Pages cannot be accessed through side bar
2.Empty task can be created 
3.Counter does not display the total number of tasks found when search is performed

**3.Fixed bug in design for documentation** 

Bug found:

Missing requirements for Create Task page in the documentation
